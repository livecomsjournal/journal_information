The [Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science](http://livecomsjournal.org) (LiveCoMS) provides a low-cost, peer-reviewed home for manuscripts which will document and strengthen community standards in molecular modeling and simulation.
LiveCoMS is a non-profit journal run by and for members of the molecular simulation community.
Currently, five categories of articles are being solicited:
- [Best Practices](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/best_practices/)
- [Reviews](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/perpetual_reviews/)
- [Tutorials](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/tutorials/)
- [Comparisons between software packages](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/compare_simulations/)
- [Lessons learned](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/lessons_learned/)
All these works are expected to be living documents, [regularly updated on GitHub with community input](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/about/paper_code/).

For more on LiveCoMS, be sure to read our vision document on [Why we need the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science](http://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/2031-why-we-need-the-living-journal-of-computational-molecular-science).

If you are interested in submitting, please see [author instructions](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/) and [editorial policies](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/policies/).  Submission is via the [journal website](http://livecomsjournal.org).
